Developed a sepsis prediction system utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and identify early signs of sepsis. The project incorporates various clinical parameters, such as vital signs, lab results, and patient history, to create a predictive model that aids healthcare professionals in making timely interventions. The system aims to improve patient outcomes by enabling early detection and treatment of sepsis, ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality associated with this critical condition.
